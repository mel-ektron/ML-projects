# Author-Attribution

This repository's purpose is examine of different approaches to author attribution with different methods. First aprroach is the classic one, TF-IDF. Then Burrow's Delta and finally BERT.
I compared two book, Emma from Jane Austen and Wuthering Hills from Emily Bronte. I used _urllib_ for extraction from gutenberg to stay updated. Also, I decided treshold as 0.75 and examples are: Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre and Dune.
As expected, accuracy rate is BERT>Burrow'delta>TF-IDF

Code is basic (and mostly genai) but you can look up to mathematics behind the models with attached the presentation. It is not advanced mathematics, despite my expectations and can be understood with basic statistic background. 

Hope it'll be helpfull.
